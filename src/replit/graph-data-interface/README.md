# About
Testing ground for connecting with & querying from [Neo4j Graph databases](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/) as well as sqlite

With a pretty printer for sqlite records

> If you are going to scrape the neo4j password, tough luck, I've replaced it with the rickroll link

> the sqlite contents are in the test.db, though the contents are just the commented out lines if you want to double check

## [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/)
Cool graph database, uses [`Cypher`](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-cheat-sheet/5/all/) as the database querying language with a lot of pattern matching potential

still trying to find personal use case

> The reason I have gone into this database, might have been a result of my [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) era

## SQLite
Old reliable, can't go wrong with sqlite, simple, no need to set up a server

Just great stuff all around
