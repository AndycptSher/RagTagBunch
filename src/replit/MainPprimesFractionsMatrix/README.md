# About
This was one of many attempts at creating an all encompasing math library in python (around 2020 ish?)

Near the end of it's life it became a personal prime generator and getter hosted at replit's expense(4.7M primes generated)

# Features Learned/Used
## POOP(Python Object Oriented Programming)
Implemented immutable datatypes

Although I didn't know it at the time, this might be the first Factory object pattern I have made

## Python magic method overriding + decorators
- getitem
- exit
- enter
- repr
- numerous arithmetic operators

Also tried multidispatch/method overloading, trying to mimic java, but I think it didn't work in the end

plus it was just stupid to try and enforce typing using that method I think looking back

## File IO
I think I knew csv's were just text, but just in case I used a csv specific library to interact with it, just to learn a new library

This might be the first, or just biggest attempt at caching/memoization

## Matrices
Just a review on how to do math on matracies

## Representing a Fraction **and** doing arithmetic on it
To think if an efficent way, that's just rough buddy

No wonder nobody has innovated on the floating point

## Sieve of Eratosthenes
It was fun implementing this

I think I contemplated also having Dijkstra's prime finding algorithm, but never got around to it

## Generators
First taste of things that can continue calculations/operations even when it's done

Now I know to compare it to async, but it was definitely a wonderful concept to play around with

Glad to see there's some testing this early on

There was a lot more functional programming in here than I remembered
